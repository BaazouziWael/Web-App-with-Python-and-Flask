# Web-App-with-Python-and-Flask

In this project, I will learn the basics of web application development with Python using the Flask framework. Through hands on, practical experience, i will go through concepts like creating a Flask Application, using Templates in Flask Applications, using SQLAlchemy and SQLite with Flask, and using Flask and WTForms. I will then apply the concepts to create my first web application with Python and Flask.

This project is aimed at learners who are looking to get started with web application development using Python, and have some prior programming experience in the Python programming language. The ideal learner has understanding of Python syntax, HTML syntax, and computer programming concepts.
